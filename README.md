Licensing
=========
My original intent was to release this code under the more liberal MIT license, however since I'm linking to farbtastic (which is GPLed), this code needs to be GPLed as well.  If you want to use this code under the MIT license, you have my permission to do so if you remove the dependency on farbtastic and replace it with another color picker.
